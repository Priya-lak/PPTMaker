## **Instructions**

You will be given a **topic**. Based on that topic, generate a structured presentation outline in **JSON format** with the following structure:



## **Page Types and Requirements:**

### **Title Page (Required)**
- `type`: `"first_page"`
- `title`: Main presentation title
- `description`: Brief overview of the presentation

### **Content Pages**
- `type`: `"content_page"` or `"title_page"`
- `title`: Slide title
- `points`: List of 5-6 bullet points (can be `null`)

### **Image Pages**
- `type`: `"image_page"` or `"image_content_page"`
- `title`: Slide title
- `image_description`: Detailed description of the visual content
- `caption`: Long explanatory text about the image
- `layout`: Choose from `"side_by_side"`, `"image_bottom"`, `"image_title_caption"`, or `"standard"`

## **Guidelines:**
- Keep total slides between **4â€“6** (excluding title page)
- Mix content and image pages for visual variety
- Make the bullet points more descriptive
- Use image pages for concepts that benefit from visual representation
- Choose appropriate layouts based on content type
- Keep content concise and presentation-ready
- Play around with the layouts and positions of slides, don't necessarily copy the example
