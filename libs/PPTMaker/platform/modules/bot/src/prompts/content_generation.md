# **Instructions**

You will be given a **topic**. Based on that topic, generate a structured presentation in JSON format using the **PresentationModel** schema below. Each slide must adhere to one of the specified layout models.

---

## **Slide Layout Options (Enum: SlideLayout)**

Each slide must conform to one of these layouts:

* `TITLE`: Title slide
* `TITLE_AND_CONTENT`: Content with bullet points
* `SECTION_HEADER`: Section heading with subtitle
* `TWO_CONTENT`: Two-column content
* `COMPARISON`: Side-by-side comparison with labeled sections
* `TITLE_ONLY`: Title only (no content)
* `BLANK`: Blank slide with title and subtitle
* `CONTENT_WITH_CAPTION`: Content + long caption paragraph

---

## **Guidelines:**

* Start with a `TITLE` layout for the opening slide
* Use a **mix** of slide types for visual and informational diversity
* Ensure bullet points are informative and presentation-ready
* Use `CONTENT_WITH_CAPTION` layout where a visual explanation or long paragraph would be appropriate
* Use `SECTION_HEADER` or `TITLE_ONLY` to break content flow or introduce a new segment
* Each content slide should have **4â€“6 detailed bullet points**
* Avoid repeating slide types too often
* Organize content logically and clearly

---

These examples demonstrate various structural approaches:
- **Example 1**: Starts with problem, moves through solutions, ends with action items
- **Example 2**: Opens with analysis, focuses on strategy, concludes with implementation
- **Example 3**: Uses chronological flow with comparative analysis
- **Example 4**: Begins conceptually, examines multiple perspectives, grounds in reality
- **Example 5**: Starts with fundamentals, progresses to advanced concepts, ends with actionable steps

Notice how different slide types appear in various positions, showing flexibility in presentation flow and structure.
